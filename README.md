### 📄 Abstract

Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their decisions remains challenging – even for relatively simpler tasks such as classification – which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations, leading to less reliable interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose ContrastCAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations, Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. 
Experimental results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT consistently outperforms stateof-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF setting, it achieves average improvements of ×1.30 in AOPC and ×2.25 in LOdds over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interpretability for transformer-based text classification.
